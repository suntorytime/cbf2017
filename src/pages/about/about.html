  <h2>Northern California Cherry Blossom Festival</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the Northern California Cherry Blossom Festival®, one of California’s most prominent celebrations of Asian traditions and the biggest on the West coast. Starting in 1968, the festival serves to cultivate the continued alliance between Japan and United States using culture as its bridge.</p>
  <p>Each year, over 200,000 people attend this dazzling display showcasing the color and grace of the Japanese culture and the diversity of the Japanese American Community. We expect this year to be filled with special events and new attractions.</p>
  <p>This year’s Northern California Cherry Blossom Festival will be held on Saturday and Sunday, April 14-15 and April 21-22, 2018. All are welcome to join in the festivities as we celebrate Japanese and Japanese American culture in San Francisco’s Japantown!</p>
  <p>The festival will be held within the borders of Laguna and Fillmore Streets and Geary Boulevard. There will be food booths, cultural performances, martial arts, live bands, the annual Queen Program, and more. The Grand Parade will be held on Sunday, April 22, beginning at 1pm starting from City Hall and concluding in Japantown.</p>
  <p>Please join us and become a sponsor, volunteer or visitor of this popular Japanese American community event. The event is free and open to the public. Vendors will be charging for their food goods and some retail products; and some specialized events will require a fee.</p>
